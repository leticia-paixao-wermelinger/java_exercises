Classes, Objects, and Access Methods:

Implement a model class in Java and develop a test application to create and use different objects based on this model.
Create a class named 'Computer' with five attributes to represent a computer object.
The class must have two constructors:
A default constructor (without parameters).
A parameterized constructor that takes all five attributes as arguments.
Implement getter and setter methods for each attribute.
Include a method named imprimir to display all attribute values.
Create a separate application class that:
Instantiates four 'Computer' objects.
Requests user input to populate the attributes of each object.
Displays all attributes of the four objects using the 'print' method.
Uses the default constructor for two objects and the parameterized constructor for the other two.
Ensure the model class and the test application are implemented separately.
